# localdevsetup
Bash script to setup a local development environment to work on a Drupal website using docker containers on Ubuntu.

Place this script in the folder where you want to make subfolders for projects and run. You can specify the name of the new environment on the command line or you will be asked for one. You will be asked to enter a sudo password to properly setup permissions and ownership of files and folders.  Your user should be apart of the docker group.
